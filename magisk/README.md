## Configuration

Foxy Boot uses black background color and white foreground color by default. The font scale is dependent on display DPI.
These values can be changed using the following system properties:

* `foxy.boot.scale` — scale factor, can take integer values from 1 to 9
* `foxy.boot.background` ­— background color in hex format (e.g. #000000)
* `foxy.boot.foreground` ­— foreground color in hex format (e.g. #ffffff)
* `foxy.boot.source` ­— message source (`kmsg` for the kernel ring buffer or `logd` for Android log)

These properties can be changed using init shell script. For instance, you can create `foxy-boot.sh` in
`/data/adb/post-fs-data.d` (don't forget to make it executable via `chmod a+x`) with the following
commands:

```sh
resetprop 'foxy.boot.scale' 2
resetprop 'foxy.boot.background' '#ffffff'
resetprop 'foxy.boot.foreground' '#000000'
resetprop 'foxy.boot.source' 'logd'
```

## ABI and Linking Issues

Foxy Boot works with private Android API which is not available in NDK. It's dynamically linked against stub libraries
which should resemble the real libraries in the system, however successful linking and full ABI compatibility on the
real Android system cannot be guaranteed.

The program is also dynamically linked against `libc++.so`, which may be unavailable on some Android devices.

The installer script will perform necessary checks and patch the binaries accordingly. It will also report linker errors
so they could be reported at my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kitsunyan/foxy-boot).
